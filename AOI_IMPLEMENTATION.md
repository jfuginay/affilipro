# AOI Management Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive AOI (Area of Interest) management dashboard for the OmniCOT ATAK plugin. Users can now view, manage, and interact with all shapes drawn on the map.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **AOI Dashboard**
   - Displays all currently drawn ATAK shapes (rectangles, circles, polygons, freehand)
   - Shows empty state with instructions when no shapes exist
   - Accessible via main plugin toolbar button

### 2. **AOI Card Display**
   Each AOI is shown in a card with:
   - **Name**: Shape name/callsign or "Unnamed AOI"
   - **Shape Type**: Circle, Rectangle, Polygon, or Freehand
   - **Area**: Calculated area in m² or km²
   - **Center Coordinates**: Lat/Long of shape center
   - **Action Buttons**:
     - "Zoom To" - Navigates map to show the AOI
     - "Delete" - Removes the AOI from the map

### 3. **User Interactions**
   - **Click on card**: Zooms map to that AOI
   - **Zoom To button**: Same as clicking card
   - **Delete button**: Removes AOI with confirmation toast
   - **Refresh button**: Manually refreshes the AOI list

### 4. **Empty State**
   When no shapes are drawn, displays:
   - Icon indicating no AOIs
   - Clear instructions on how to create AOIs:
     1. Tap Drawing Tools icon
     2. Select shape type (Rectangle/Circle/Freehand)
     3. Draw on map
     4. Return to dashboard

## Files Created

### Java Classes
1. **AoiInfo.java**
   - Data model representing an AOI
   - Stores: UID, name, shape type, center point, area, MapItem reference
   - Provides formatted strings for display

2. **AoiManager.java**
   - Utility class to query ATAK map for shapes
   - `getAllAois()`: Finds all shapes on map recursively
   - `zoomToAoi()`: Navigates map to show specific AOI
   - `deleteAoi()`: Removes AOI from map
   - Supports: DrawingCircle, DrawingRectangle, generic Shape

3. **AoiAdapter.java**
   - RecyclerView adapter for displaying AOI cards
   - Binds AOI data to card views
   - Handles click events via listener interface

### Layout Files
1. **aoi_management_layout.xml**
   - Main dashboard layout
   - Contains header with "AOI Management" title and refresh button
   - RecyclerView for AOI cards
   - Empty state container with icon and instructions

2. **aoi_card_item.xml**
   - Individual AOI card layout
   - Dark theme CardView with elevation
   - Displays all AOI information
   - Contains zoom and delete action buttons

### Resources
1. **icon_aoi.xml**
   - Vector drawable icon for AOI feature
   - Orange circle with white map/boundary shape

2. **strings.xml** (updated)
   - Added AOI-related strings:
     - Titles, labels, instructions
     - Toast messages for actions

### Modified Files
1. **OmniCOTPlugin.java**
   - Updated imports for RecyclerView support
   - Changed from simple text pane to AOI management dashboard
   - Added `refreshAoiList()` method to load and display AOIs
   - Integrated AoiAdapter with click handlers
   - Shows/hides empty state based on AOI count

## Technical Details

### Shape Detection
The system detects these ATAK shape types:
- `DrawingCircle` - Circular AOIs
- `DrawingRectangle` - Rectangular AOIs  
- `Shape` - Generic shapes (polygons, freehand)

### Area Calculation
- Circles: π × radius²
- Polygons/Rectangles: Shoelace formula with geographic coordinate approximation
- Results displayed in m² (< 1000) or km² (≥ 1000)

### Map Navigation
- Calculates bounds of shape from all points
- Centers map on shape's center point
- Adjusts zoom level based on shape size

### UI/UX
- Dark theme matching ATAK aesthetics
- Material Design CardView components
- Responsive layout with RecyclerView
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Empty state for better UX when no AOIs exist

## Usage Flow

1. **User clicks OmniCOT toolbar button**
   → AOI Management dashboard opens

2. **If no shapes on map**
   → Empty state shows with creation instructions

3. **If shapes exist**
   → Cards displayed in scrollable list
   → Each card shows shape info and actions

4. **User taps "Zoom To" or clicks card**
   → Map animates to show that AOI

5. **User taps "Delete"**
   → AOI removed from map
   → List refreshes automatically
   → Toast confirms deletion

6. **User taps "Refresh"**
   → List reloads from map
   → Toast confirms refresh

## Integration with Existing Plugin
- Works alongside existing affiliation change functionality
- Reuses `AffiliationUpdater.showToast()` for consistent notifications
- Maintains plugin architecture and lifecycle
- No conflicts with radial menu factory

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. Filter by shape type (show only circles, rectangles, etc.)
2. Sort options (by name, area, distance from self)
3. Edit AOI properties (rename, change color)
4. Export AOI coordinates
5. Share AOIs via COT
6. Search/filter by name
7. AOI details screen with more information
8. Add custom metadata to AOIs

## Testing Recommendations
1. Draw various shapes on map (circle, rectangle, polygon)
2. Open AOI dashboard - verify all shapes appear
3. Test zoom functionality on each AOI
4. Test delete functionality
5. Verify empty state when no shapes exist
6. Test refresh after drawing new shapes
7. Verify proper cleanup when plugin stops

## Notes
- All UI uses dark theme to match ATAK
- RecyclerView efficiently handles large numbers of AOIs
- Automatic refresh when deleting ensures UI stays in sync
- Click on entire card provides same action as "Zoom To" button for better UX
